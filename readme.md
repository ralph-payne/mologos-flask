# MOLOGOS FLASK

### Project Overview
I built Mologos because I wanted a site to store words I was learning in foreign languages. I didnâ€™t want to rely on Google Translate and I wanted to have the option of modifying the translation and then testing myself by using my own examples.


### Here are some of the features:
User Authentication and User Authentication
SQL Postgres Database
API interactions (py-translate and the Merriam Webster APIs)
Ability for users to bulk upload many words and translations
